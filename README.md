I think the images that are printed on top of the code is rlly cool :) I think having to earn money def adds an incentive to the player.
More interesting if there are colors added to the images. Maybe list the price of the house? Also include like how the house is bigger in size after upgrading it.

Very good code, a game that i would actully play,
I like the idea of having a game that is not linear until a definite end, this game can go on infinetly which makes it unique.

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/402504/how-to-determine-a-python-variables-type
    - Used for variable type confirmation in Location class within `locations.py` file. This is to ensure that the g
    argument passed into Location methods are always of the Game type.
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions
    - List of Python exceptions. I referenced this website to determine which exceptions I would use for my `try:` and
    `except:` statements, used in the `prompt()` method of the Game class within the `game.py` file.
* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/assertions_in_python.htm
    - I learned how to write assertions in Python. An assertion was used in each of the enter/execute/exit methods of
    the Location class and all child classes. This assertion was used to ensure that the g argument passed into the
    Location methods are always of the Game type.
* https://www.pixilart.com/
    - A free, online pixel art editor I used to generate pixel art that was then converted into ASCII art on
    https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/. 
* https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/
    - A website used to generate ASCII art from image files. ASCII art generated by this website was featured in the
    ASCII images for the title screen and the house/shop/farm locations.
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eval-in-python/
    - I learned about the `eval()` function in Python from this article. The `eval()` function was used to evaluate the
    answer to math questions in the harvesting mode of the Farm location.
